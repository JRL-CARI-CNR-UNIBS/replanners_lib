# **replanners_lib**

The **replanners_lib** package provides a collection of sample-based path replanning algorithms.

 This is the list of the currently implemented replanners:

1. [MARS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10013661?source=authoralert)
2. [DRRT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1641879)
3. [Anytime DRRT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209270)
4. [DRRT*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8122814)
5. [MPRRT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7027233)

*replanners_lib* depends on [*graph_core*](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/cari_motion_planning/tree/master), which provides the necessary classes and solvers for path planning problems.

## Installation

To install *replanners_lib*, follow these steps:

```bash
mkdir -p replanners_lib_ws/build/replanners_lib && cd replanners_lib_ws
cmake -S replanners_lib -B build/replanners_lib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/replanners_lib_ws/install
make -C build/replanners_lib install
```

## ROS Compatibility

While *replanners_lib* is ROS-free, it can utilize [*graph_display*](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/graph_display/tree/cesare-devel) for debugging if ROS is available. *graph_display* provides functionalities to display paths, trees, etc., in Rviz and is integrated into some replanners for debugging purposes. If ROS is available and sourced this opion is ON by default, but you can disable it by setting  `-DUSE_GRAPH_DISPLAY=False`

If you are using ROS 1 and want to include this package into a ROS package, download *replanners_lib* in a catkin workspace and set `catkin config --install`. to allow other ROS packages to find it.
